<h2 id="what-is-simplefoc">What is SimpleFOC?</h2>
<p><img src="https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/173681491/717e1b00-8c9f-11ea-83f4-513489af9d3b" alt="SimpleFOC" width="400"/></p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simplefoc/Arduino-FOC">SimpleFOC library</a> is an open-source library for controlling brushless DC (BLDC) motors with Field Oriented Control (FOC) algorithms. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mLuU1Nscu4">Brushless motor control is awesome for robotics</a> but it can be quite hard to understand and implement in practice, and existing solutions are often very specific to certain (expensive) hardware configurations. SimpleFOC has gained increasing popularity within the hobby community because it provides an open-source and user-friendly library to facilitate BLDC motor control for a wide variety of motor + driver + sensor + microcontroller combinations, including low-cost ones, which has led to its widespread usage by the community hence to some amazing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLkLe2-GfXE">projects</a> 🤖</p>
<h2 id="why-a-simplefoc-ai-assistant">Why a SimpleFOC AI Assistant?</h2>
<p>As the community grows, there are more and more questions that pop up into the <a href="https://community.simplefoc.com/">SimpleFOC community forum</a> spanning various queries such as resolving potential hardware or installation issues, asking for advice in choosing the right setup, understanding bugs in one's code, etc. While those questions can be very diverse and some of them can be hard to answer, even for the expert members of the SimpleFOC community, there also are questions for which the answers can often be found already online, notably in the <a href="https://docs.simplefoc.com/">SimpleFOC documentation</a> (or in other online resources). However for users it can be quite complicated or time-expensive to directly search for information in the SimpleFOC or other support docs as these documentations can become quite long and hard to parse, especially for beginners. This is where an AI Assistant could be very handy: the user could directly ask question in natural language form to the AI assistant, which could go and retrieve the relevant information from these docs automatically, and then communicate it back to the user into a comprehensive and concise manner, redirecting toward useful resources when necessary.</p>
<p>This is exactly what we are going to try to build in this notebook. To do so, we'll see how we can turn a general LLM assistant (such as Mistral models) into a customized SimpleFOC assistant without having to re-train the weights of the networks nor having to do any kind of heavy computation. Instead, we'll simply provide the LLM with relevant information from the SimpleFOC docs as input so that the LLM can tailor its answers in a meaningful manner. This simple and neat idea is called <em>Retrieval Augmented Generation</em>, or RAG in short, and was proposed by Lewis et al. back in 2020 in <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/6b493230205f780e1bc26945df7481e5-Abstract.html">this paper</a>. The code is based on <em>open-source</em> packages and LLM weights (quantized mistral-instruct) and should be <em>easy-to-run</em>, e.g. directly in colab with a T4 free-access gpu.</p>
<h2 id="retrieval-augmented-generation">Retrieval Augmented Generation</h2>
<p>Let's start by decorticating the basic ideas behind R-A-G 👇</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieval: we want to <em>retrieve relevant information</em> given an input query. In our case, an input query would come from a user of the SimpleFOC community and could for instance ask "What are the supported position sensors with simplefoc?" or "Can esp8266 chip be used to drive 6pwm drivers with simplefoc?"</li>
<li>Augmented: The way this information is passed to the LLM is simply by <em>augmenting the prompt</em> with that retrieved knowledge</li>
<li>Generation: retrieval augmentation is fed as inputs to the LLM which returns <em>generative outputs</em>, as usual with LLMs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why RAG could be useful to construct our SimpleFOC AI Assistant?</p>
<p>Well first, mainstream AI assistants such as variants of GPT, LLama and Mistrals tend to return <em>generic</em> information, as they are trained from massive amount of data from the internet. In our target use-case questions will be specific to details of the SimpleFOC library and we want the answer to communicate the true information from SimpleFOC support and docs, or at least to communicate uncertainty when it cannot find the answer within the docs. Yet, this is not the case when using off-the-shelf LLMs, despite the fact that it is very likely that SimpleFOC docs, which are hosted on github, have been part of the training data of these LLMs.</p>
<p>For instance let's have a look of what ChatGPT 4 answers to some questions SimpleFOC users might have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>User:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can esp8266 chip be used to drive 6pwm drivers with simplefoc?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ESP8266 chip can indeed be used to drive motors using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), and integrating it with the SimpleFOC (Field Oriented Control) library is technically feasible for controlling brushless motors with precision. However, there are a few considerations to keep in mind when attempting to use it to drive 6 PWM drivers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1. GPIO Pins:</strong> The ESP8266 has a limited number of GPIO pins available for use, and not all of them can be used for PWM output. You'll need to ensure that the ESP8266 module you're using has enough PWM-capable GPIO pins for your application. For 6 PWM drivers, you'll need at least 6 PWM-capable pins, assuming one PWM signal per driver.</p>
<p><strong>2. PWM Channels:</strong> The ESP8266 hardware supports a limited number of PWM channels. This limitation can sometimes be circumvented by software PWM libraries, but this might introduce limitations in terms of performance and accuracy. It's crucial to check if the PWM resolution and frequency meet your requirements for motor control.</p>
<p><strong>3. Processing Power and Timing:</strong> The ESP8266 is quite capable in terms of processing power for many applications, but running sophisticated control algorithms like those required for precise motor control with SimpleFOC on 6 motors simultaneously might push its limits, especially if other tasks (like Wi-Fi communication) are being performed. Timing precision is vital for motor control, and the ESP8266's multitasking environment might introduce jitter.</p>
<p><strong>4. SimpleFOC Library Compatibility:</strong> The SimpleFOC library is designed to be hardware-agnostic, but its performance and the features available can vary significantly between different microcontroller platforms. Ensure that the library supports the ESP8266 with the features you need, especially regarding the number of motors and the control precision.</p>
<p><strong>5. Power Supply and Driver Compatibility:</strong> Make sure that your motor drivers are compatible with the PWM signal levels of the ESP8266 and that they can handle the required power levels for your motors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a project driving 6 PWM drivers with an ESP8266 using SimpleFOC, you might need to carefully manage resources, possibly modify the library for better compatibility, or use additional hardware like PWM expanders. It's also a good idea to look into the community forums or documentation for any similar projects or guidance specific to your application needs.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>👉 A first problematic here is that the answer from GPT tend to be quite long and generic, whereas this question rather expects some YES or NO answer.</p>
<p>👉 Moreover, if we take the time to read the answer we get the understanding that YES it is possible to use an ESP8266 microcontroller be to drive 6pwm drivers with simplefoc. Unfortunately, as reported in <a href="https://docs.simplefoc.com/microcontrollers#choosing-the-microcontroller">this table</a> of SimpleFOC docs, this is not true.
This issue, often called <strong>hallucination</strong>, is a well-known limitation of LLMs: LLMs can generate "good looking" text that sounds convincing, but it does not mean that it is true or factual, which is something that we want to remedy in our target use-case.</p>
<p>Let's look at another question that a user might have, to which we add <em>"Give a concise answer based on the simpleFOC documentation"</em> to avoid too lenghty answers, and see how ChatGPT 4 answers it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>User:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>User
Simplefoc compiles and I flush it to my board, but nothing moves. I use platformio, what could be the problem? Give a concise answer based on the simpleFOC documentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If SimpleFOC compiles and you've flashed it to your board but nothing moves, the issue could stem from a few common areas according to the SimpleFOC documentation. Here's a concise checklist of things to verify:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Wiring and Connections</strong>: Ensure all connections are secure and correctly wired, including the motor to the driver, the driver to the microcontroller, and any sensors you are using.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Motor and Driver Compatibility</strong>: Verify that the motor is compatible with the driver you're using and that the driver can handle the motor's current and voltage requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Power Supply</strong>: Ensure that the power supply is adequate for your motor and driver. It should meet the voltage and current requirements of your system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Configuration and Calibration</strong>: Check if the motor, driver, and any sensor configurations in your code match your hardware setup. This includes motor parameters (pole pairs, current limit, etc.) and sensor calibration if using encoders or other position sensors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Code Upload</strong>: Confirm that the code has been successfully uploaded to the board. Sometimes, the upload process might appear successful, but issues like incorrect board settings in PlatformIO can cause the firmware not to run as expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Motor Control Code</strong>: Ensure that your motor control code (loop) is correctly implemented. This includes initializing the motor and driver, setting the target value (velocity, position, or torque), and periodically updating the motor controller in your loop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debugging</strong>: Use serial print statements to debug your code. Check for any errors or warnings during initialization and operation. Verify that the sensor readings (if applicable) are reasonable and that the control loop is active.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>If after checking these areas the problem persists, consulting the SimpleFOC community forum or GitHub issues page may provide additional insight or solutions specific to your hardware setup and application.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>👉 Again we have a generic answer with generic recommandations and misses to answer with specific relevant information from the SimpleFOC resources. Yet, there is a very common explanation to the issue raised by this user when using PlatformIO with SimpleFOC which is to not forget to add the <code>lib_archive=False</code> option to the <code>platfromio.ini</code> file as well explained <a href="https://docs.simplefoc.com/library_platformio">here</a> in the docs and as commonly reminded in the <a href="https://community.simplefoc.com/search?q=platformio%20lib_archive">SimpleFOC forum</a>. We would like the AI Assistant to remind this to the user and to emphasize is as possible cause for the error.</p>
<p>In summary, RAG should a priori be useful in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>RAG can help prevent hallucinations by prompting the LLM with information based on relevant passages from the docs that are factual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RAG can help specify the responses with information coming from actual data, offering more interpretability as we know where the generations came from, instead of providing generic responses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="rag-pipeline">RAG Pipeline</h2>
<p><img alt="pipeline" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mayalenE/simple-foc-assistant/main/rag-pipeline.png" /></p>
<p>As summarized in the above figure, we are going to follow the following steps
in this notebook:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the SimpleFOC documentation (collection of markdown files)</li>
<li>Format and pre-process the documentation into chuncks of tokens</li>
<li>Embed all of the chunks into numerical reprentations (embedding) using an <strong>Embedding Model</strong></li>
<li>Setup a retrieval system that uses <strong>Vector Search</strong> to find relevant chunks of text based on a query</li>
<li>Create a prompt that augment the original query with the retrieved pieces of text</li>
<li>Use an existing LLM (e.g. quantized mistral-instruct) to generate an answer to the augmented prompt</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="main-design-choices">Main Design Choices 💡</h2>
<p>The below table recaps the main design choices that we have to care about when implementing a RAG pipeline, as they can largely influence the resulting outputs 👇</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Design Choice</strong></th>
<th><strong>Impact</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Chunking the data</strong></td>
<td>1) The way we generate chunks will directly influence the results: it is usually done with a fixed-size overlapping sliding window <br> but more advanced strategies of chunking could be envisaged such as recursive or semantic chunking as explained in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OJC21T2SL4">this video</a> <br> 2) The length of the chunks will also influence the results: smaller chunks will lead to more precise context but might miss important <br> information whereas larger chunks might hide relevant fine-grained info, and the length is limited by the LLM context length. <br> 3) How we preprocess the data before chunking is also one thing to consider as we want to remove non-useful information/tokens</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Embedding model</strong></td>
<td>The choice of the embedding model will determine which chunks of text are considered similar (in meaning) to the input query, <br> which will have a direct impact on what information is retrieved from the vector database.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Similarity search</strong></td>
<td>To find chunks relevant to the query, Vector search is often used to find vectors that are the closest in the high-demensional embedding space. <br> Design choices include the similarity score measure, which is usually a simple dot product or cosine similarity, as well as the number of retrieved tokens. <br> One could also consider replacing pure vector/semantic search with a hybrid of vector search and keyword-based search.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Large Language Model (LLM)</strong></td>
<td>Obviously the choice of the base LLM will highly impact the final results given the same RAG context and input prompt. <br> I do not have a proper tip to choose the right LLM, except that it is usually quite constrain by the hardware setup at your disposal. <br> The LLM context window, number of tokens that a LLM can accept as input, can also condition the choice, in particular for<br> the RAG pipeline where the context window will directly determine the number of reference items we can feed to the LLM. <br> I usually like to go for small open-source models because they are easy to play with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Base Prompt</strong></td>
<td>Finally, an important design choice is how we will do "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering">prompt engineering</a>" to structure the base prompt that we will augment <br> with the retrieved items, and then feed as input to the generative LLM together. The aim here is for the generated output to look <br> as close as possible to what an ideal SimpleFOC AI Assistant should answer.</td>

<p>We'll be using the <a href="https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/">LlamaIndex</a> library 🦙, that as you will see makes it very easy to implement context augmentation for LLMs with only few lines of code. We also need to install the <a href="https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/embeddings/huggingface/">llama-index-embeddings-huggingface</a> library in order to be able to load embedding models from the HuggingFace <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard">embedding leaderboard</a> 🤗, as well as Hugging Face <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index">transformers</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/index">optimum</a> libraries enabling us to load and use state-of-the art pretrained models efficiently.

<h3 id="2-process-data-as-chunks-of-tokens">2) Process data as chunks of tokens</h3>
<p>LlamaIndex will take care of everything for step 2, 3 and 4, such that we only need to specify the desired hyperparameters for those steps.</p>
<p>For step 2, pre-processing the data into chunks, we simply use a fixed-sized overlapping window method, dividing the text into chunks of fixed number of characters specified with <code>chunk_size</code> and overlapping by <code>chunk_overlap</code> characters.</p>

<h3 id="3-embed-chunks-into-a-vectordb">3) Embed chunks into a VectorDB</h3>
<p>Embedding is simply turning the chunks of text into numerical representations (embeddings). Note that these embeddings are <em>learned</em> representation vectors lying in high-dimensional space that capture semantic information of the words or phrases.</p>
<p>There are many embedding models that are available on the HF hub. A good ressource to choose a model is to check the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard">Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Leaderboard</a> which lists the current best text embedding models out there on a variety of tasks. To select a proper embedding model you generally want to have a look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model Size (number of parameters): known only for open models, but this will impact speed/memory and we want to keep that relatively small in order to be able to run it fast on colab GPUs</li>
<li>Embedding Dimension: dimensionality of the vector embedding</li>
<li>Max tokens: max number of tokens that fit into the LLM input prompt, depending on this you will have to adapt the chunk size</li>
<li>performance on tasks such that classification, clustering, retrieval, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here we'll be using the <a href="https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1">mxbai-embed-large-v1</a> model by mixed-bread-ai, which has 335M params, an embedding dimension of 1024 and can take a maximum of 512 tokens as input (which is exactly what we used as our chunk size).</p>
<p>Once you have selected an embedding model from the HF hub, you simply need to specify it using the <code>embed_model</code> setting and <code>HuggingFaceEmbedding</code> wrapper.</p>

<h3 id="4-setup-a-retrieval-system-using-vector-search">4) Setup a retrieval system using Vector Search</h3>
<p>For step 4, LlamaIndex is again taking care of everything to build a query engine using Vector Search, we simply need to explicitly disable the use of OpenAI LLM (we will use a small open-source one in Step 6) and  need to specify is the desired <code>similarity_top_k</code> setting. Here we use <code>similarity_top_k=3</code>, meaning that we will retrieve the 3 closest embeddings from our VectorDB given the user's query embedding.</p>

<p>Let's have a look at which chunks our query engine returns given the following user query <em>"Simplefoc compiles and I flush it to my board, but nothing moves. I use platformio, what could be the problem?"</em>. As a recall a good answer here should be to include the <code>lib_archive=False</code> information in the platformio.ini file, so we want the retrieval system to extract this information from the docs.</p>

<p>At this point, if it is the first project you are creating for this board, PlatformIO will download all the required compilers, tools and core library files. Depending on your internet speed, this can take quite a few minutes, so please be patient!</p>
<h2>Add <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span> to your project</h2>
<p>When everything is finished installing, you should be presented with a view like this:</p>
<p><img src="extras/Images/platformio_screenshot4.png" class="width80"></p>
<p>You can now add the SimpleFOC library to the project:</p>
<p><img src="extras/Images/platformio_screenshot5.png" class="width80">
1. Click on the PlatformIO icon, and choose "Libraries" from the Menu
2. Enter "Simple FOC" in the search
3. Click on the library</p>
<p><img src="extras/Images/platformio_screenshot6.png" class="width80">
1. Click on "Add Library" to display the "Add Library" wizard</p>
<p><img src="extras/Images/platformio_screenshot7.png" class="width50">
1. Choose your project from the drop-down
2. Click "Add" to add the library</p>
<p>Cool! The SimpleFOC library is now associated with your project.</p>
<h2>Configure your project</h2>
<p>Open the platformio.ini file in the root directory of your project. It should look something like this, depending on the board you chose:</p>
<p>```ini
; PlatformIO Project Configuration File
;
;   Build options: build flags, source filter
;   Upload options: custom upload port, speed and extra flags
;   Library options: dependencies, extra library storages
;   Advanced options: extra scripting
;
; Please visit documentation for the other options and examples
; https://docs.platformio.org/page/projectconf.html</p>
<p>[env:mkrwifi1010]

<h2>Advanced Usage</h2>
<p>PlatformIO makes it easy for you to use the source version of the SimpleFOC library. This lets you modify the code, or use the most recent "dev" branch version of the library to try out new features before they are officially released.</p>
<p>To use the source code version of the library, try the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using your favourite git client, clone the simplefoc library from https://github.com/simplefoc/Arduino-FOC.git</li>
<li>This will create a folder "Arduino-FOC" on your file-system, containing the library source code</li>
<li>Go to your PlatformIO project, and inside the project go to the lib folder. You can use your operating system's shell, or the built-in shell in Visual Studio Code.</li>
<li>Inside the lib folder of your project, create a symlink to your Arduino-FOC folder<br/>
Mac/Linux:<br/>
<code>% ln -s /path/to/Arduino-FOC</code><br/>
Windows:<br/>
<code>% mklink /J Arduino-FOC C:\path\to\Arduino-FOC</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Note: If you had previously added the release version of the library to the project using PlatformIO's library management, you will have to remove this reference from the platformio.ini file</p>

<p>👉 We can see that here RAG did a pretty good job at retrieving relevant information and in fact the instruction to set <code>lib_archive = false</code> is present in all 3 retrived chunks, so the LLM should be able to incorporate this in its answer if everything goes well.</p>

<p>Choosing the right LLM can be hard, but we are usually quite constrained in our choices depending on the GPUs hardware that we have at our disposal.

<p>Given 16GB of memory is relatively small we have to stick with small and likely <em>quantized</em> models. There are different types of quantization methods and one of them is known as <strong>GPTQ</strong>, a post-training quantization (PTQ) method that enable to compress all the weights of these models to a <strong>4-bit precision</strong> that can efficiently run on GPUs.
You can find many of these quantized models into the HF Hub, in particular you can check collections from <a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke">The Bloke AI</a> which for instance contains <a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GPTQ">Llama-2-7B-Chat-GPTQ</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ">Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/zephyr-7B-beta-GPTQ">zephyr-7B-beta-GPTQ</a>.

<h3 id="6-augment-input-prompt">6) Augment Input Prompt</h3>
<p>Now we need to do a bit of prompt-engineering work to decide what we will send as input to the LLM. In this notebook, we'll be using a quantized version of Mistral7B-Instruct. To effectively prompt the Mistral 7B Instruct and get optimal outputs, it's recommended to use the following chat template:</p>
<p><code>&lt;s&gt;[INST] Instruction [/INST] Model answer&lt;/s&gt;[INST] Follow-up instruction [/INST]</code></p>
<p><code>&lt;s&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/s&gt;</code> are special tokens indicating beginning of string (BOS) and end of string (EOS), while <code>[INST]</code> and <code>[/INST]</code> are regular strings used to delimitate the instruction/query. We can apply this template by hand, or use the <code>apply_chat_emplate</code> method from the transformers package which is what is done here.</p>
<p>Now a main question here is how to augment the prompt with the retrived chunks such that the LLM can use them most effectively. There are many different tricks to do proper prompt-engineering, most of them being referenced on <a href="https://www.promptingguide.ai/">this prompting guide</a> but what I did here is simply use the <a href="https://api.together.xyz/signin">together.ai</a> API to try different prompts "by hand" and select the one I was most happy with (<code>base_prompt</code> as shown in below cell). As you can see I basically insisted to use the information from the retrieved chunks (and even solely this information) because I felt that that generic LLMs such as Mistral-instruct tend to provide generic answers which is not what we are looking for here. To do so I added a minimal chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting by asking the model to extract relevant information from the provided context items and to reformulate their content in a clear, accessible and consise manner. I also ask the LLM to not mention these context items (because the RAG pipeline would ultimately be hidden to the user) and to directly refer to the online docs. Finally I ask the LLM to sign with "SimpleFOC_AI" so that users know that the answer is generated by an AI.</p>

<p>Great, we are now ready to pass our augmented prompt to the LLM and see what it returns. Note that there are few important parameters that we can tune here for generating an answer with the LLM, in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>do_sample: enable sampling-based decoding strategies and there are many of them such as<ul>
<li>Multinomial sampling: randomly selects the next token based on the probability distribution over the entire vocabulary, and this is what we use here by default (instead of greedily selecting the one with max predicted probability)</li>
<li>Top-k sampling (select only a portion of the top-k logits before applying softmax to gain compute efficiency)</li>
<li>Top-p sampling (given the softmax-predicted probabilities only consider the most likely tokens whose cummulated probabilities &gt; p)</li>
<li>I recommend <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2024/01/16/sampling">this blogpost</a> for more information on sampling strategies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>temperature: parameters that is used to scale the logits (outputs of the LLM) before they are fed to softmax sampling such that a temperature of 0 will result in deterministic outputs (softmax+$\tau=0$ &lt;=&gt; hard max) and a higher temperature will result in more diverse/creative outputs. We generally consider $0&lt;\tau&lt;1$.</li>

<div class="output"><pre> SimpleFOC_AI: I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing issues with SimpleFOC not moving your motor after compiling and flashing through PlatformIO. Here are a few suggestions to help you troubleshoot the problem:

1. Check your wiring: Make sure all your motor connections are correct and properly connected to the board. Double-check the motor polarities, ground, and power connections.

2. Verify your motor configuration: Review the SimpleFOC library documentation (<https://docs.simplefoc.com/>) and ensure that the motor configuration in your code matches your motor setup. The library supports various motor types and configurations, so it's essential to choose the correct one.

3. Check your motor parameters: In your code, the SimpleFOC library requires specific motor parameters, such as motor type, RPM, phase resistances, and inductances. Ensure all these parameters are correctly set for your motor.

4. Debugging: Use the Serial Monitor in Visual Studio Code (or another terminal) to check for any error messages or issues in your code. You can also add debug statements to your code to inspect variables or motor states.

5. Firmware version: Ensure you are using the latest SimpleFOC library version that supports your motor and board. Sometimes compatibility issues can cause problems. You can check for the latest library release on GitHub (<https://github.com/simplefoc/Arduino-FOC/releases>).

6. PlatformIO configuration: Double-check your platformio.ini file for any misconfigurations or missing settings. Ensure the 'lib_archive' option is set to 'false' as required for SimpleFOC.

7. Hardware issues: If all the above steps do not help, consider checking your hardware for any defects. Try using a different motor or board to rule out any hardware-related issues.

If you still cannot find a solution, you can reach out to the SimpleFOC community for help on their official forum (<https://discourse.simplefoc.com/>) or contact the SimpleFOC team for further assistance.

<p>Cool, there is the desired information (check <code>lib_archive=false</code> option in the <code>platform.ini</code> file) and the answer is correct and useful 😀</p>
<p>However there are still room for improvement: the important information appears quite late in the answer (point 6) and when we do several samples the answer is not alway as good...</p>

<p>SimpleFOC_AI: I'm here to help answer any queries you have regarding the SimpleFOC library. Based on the information provided, ESP8266 chips do not fully meet the requirements for using 6PWM motor control with SimpleFOC.

<p>👉 For the first question, unfortunately all outputs are incorrect hallucinations 😓 Indeed they all suggest thar Arduino UNO is not able to produce 6pwm signals with SimpleFOC, whereas it actually is. Looking at the RAG retrieved items for this query, we see that it retrived a chunk coming from <a href="https://docs.simplefoc.com/esp_mcu#esp8266-boards-support">this part</a> of the documentation about ESP8266 which says that "These boards have only 4 pwm pins so the 6PWM motor control cannot be implemented" and cutting the previous info that this is ESP8266 and not Arduino UNO, which is likely the cause of hallucinations here.</p>
<p>👉 For the second question however the generated answers are very good, providing correct information and refering to the docs for additional information which is great (and better to what we got with chatGPT at the beginning).</p>

<p>SimpleFOC_AI: I'm glad you're interested in SimpleFOC's current sensing capabilities with the STM32 H7 microcontroller family. According to the SimpleFOC documentation, low-side current sensing is supported for the STM32 H7 family, specifically on the B-G431B-ESC1 board. However, the documentation also states that the SAMD21 architecture is under development and its low-side current sensing implementation is not yet fully tested, so I would recommend exercising caution when relying on it.</p>
<p>Since you've asked about low-side current sensing specifically for the STM32 H7 family, I'd like to clarify that this architecture supports one motor with low-side current sensing. Keep in mind that low-side current sensing requires a very high synchronization between the PWM generated by the driver and the ADC triggering, so it's important to consider the PWM frequency and the PWM pins when choosing the driver parameters.</p>
<p>For more information, you can refer to the SimpleFOC documentation on current sensing (<a href="https://docs.simplefoc.com/current-sensing/">https://docs.simplefoc.com/current-sensing/</a>) and the MCU support page (<a href="https://docs.simplefoc.com/MCU-support/">https://docs.simplefoc.com/MCU-support/</a>).</p>

<p>SimpleFOC_AI: I'm glad you're interested in using the SimpleFOC library for your Teensy microcontroller project. Regarding your question, the current version of SimpleFOC does not support low-side current sensing for Teensy microcontrollers. The library currently supports in-line current sensing for this platform. However, the development team aims to make SimpleFOC as interchangeable as possible across different drivers and platforms, so new features and improvements, including low-side current sensing for Teensy, may be added in future releases. Be sure to check the SimpleFOC documentation at <a href="https://docs.simplefoc.com/">https://docs.simplefoc.com/</a> for the latest information.</p>
</div></div>
<p>👉 For the question about low-side sensing support for the stm32 l4 family, the answers does not convey confidently that they support low-side sensing (which is the case), but what I like is that they neither convey the feeling that they don't support it but rather that the AI assistant is uncertain about this query, and that user should check the SimpleFOC website for more accurate informationn which is much better than hallucinating false information. Actually here when we look at the retrieved information from the docs, we understand why the LLM is uncertain as the information is not so clearly explained in the docs. For instance it is emphasized that Stm32 f1, f4 and g4 families support low-side sensing for only one motor which looks like it <em>implicitely</em> suggests that Stm32 l4 family does not support low-side support in contrast, whether what it actually suggests is that l4 family support it for more than one motor as well. Maybe this tool could actually be useful to write better docs 😆</p>
<p>👉 For the same question about stm32 h7 family, there are 2 out of 3 answers that are correct with the last one being the incorrect one. But its not so bad as once again the information is not clearly stated in the docs, for instance the h7 family is not included in <a href="https://docs.simplefoc.com/stm32_mcu#stm32-boards-support">this table</a> which summarizes stm32 support. There is also a problem in the second answer, which wrongly suggests that B-G431B-ESC1 board which however is listed in the table, is from the h7 family, but this is wrong.</p>
<p>👉 Finally for the same question about teensy microcontrollers, all 3 answers are correct and concise, referring to the SimpleFOC docs which is nice! However they often refer to the "provided context" or even "context items" despite me asking explicitely referring in the base prompt to not refer to those (as these would be hidden to the user), so there is probably some further improvements to make to the base prompt!</p>
<h3 id="test-3">Test 3</h3>
<p>We are again testing information contained within the same page in the docs, but answering it requires a bit more of context as the user is asking for advice between several configurations, and the LLM should reason and compare the different options based on the info provided in the docs. Moreover there is various terms that the LLM should know about e.g. "nucleo f411re" is a specific nucleo board from the stm32 microcontroller f4 family.</p>
<p>The answers should be the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>"If I have a choice between Arduino UNO, esp32 and stm32f1 chip, which one should I use if I wanna run 2 bldc motors with simplefoc with encoders and low-side current sensing?" --&gt; should say esp32</li>
<li>"If I have a choice between Arduino UNO and nucleo f411re, which one is a better choice for smooth motor control with simplefoc? " --&gt; should say nucleo f411re (equivalent to stm32 f4 family)</li>
<li>"If I have a choice between teensy 4.0 and stm32f1 and a 6pwm driver, which one should I use with simplefoc?" --&gt; should say teensy 4.0</li>

<p>👉 UNO vs esp32 vs stm32f1: unfortunately all the answers suggest to use stm32f1 rather than esp32, and it does not understand than esp32 is the only one which can support 2 motors. But again it is not so bad as the information is still correct and it is true that it is not so clear in the docs to understand that esp32 is supporting two motors e.g. in <a href="https://docs.simplefoc.com/microcontrollers#choosing-the-microcontroller">the 3rd table from this section</a> it is the only line which has a ✅ and that does not say "one-motor" but for the LLM to accurately find and interpret this information is very hard.</p>
<p>👉 UNO vs nucleo f411re: perfect 3/3 here!</p>
<p>👉 teensy vs stm32f1:  2/3 here as the last answer is wrong and even suggests confidently that "Teensy 4.0 supports both low-side and high-side current sensing out of the box" which is completely false! Moreover in the second answer there is also a suggestion that "Teensy 4.0 uses an ARM Cortex-M7 processor, which provides 35 PWMs" which might be an hallucination (to check) and is anyway irrelevant here as the question asks for 6PWM. It also provides a link to the simplefoc documentation which does not exists. Could be better!</p>

<p>This question is the example we chose at the beginning, which is a commonly raised question by the community when using SimpleFOC library with PlatformIO and for which the relevant docs is accessible here: <a href="https://docs.simplefoc.com/library_platformio">https://docs.simplefoc.com/library_platformio</a>.</p>
<p>The answer should be the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Simplefoc compiles and I flush it to my board, but nothing moves. I use platformio, what could be the problem?" --&gt; It should suggest to add <code>lib_archive = false</code> to the platrofrmio.ini file</li>

<p>SimpleFOC_AI: I'm here to help you troubleshoot issues you might have with using SimpleFOC library in PlatformIO. Based on the information you've provided, it seems that your SimpleFOC code is compiling and being uploaded to your board, but the motors are not moving. Here are some possible causes and solutions for this issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Check the wiring</strong>: Make sure that the motors are properly connected to the board, and that the motor phases, grounds, and power sources are all wired correctly. You can consult the SimpleFOC documentation to verify the wiring scheme for your motor type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check the code</strong>: Ensure that your code is written correctly and that the motor configuration parameters, such as the motor type, direction, and PID gains, are set correctly. You can refer to the SimpleFOC documentation for examples on how to configure and use the library in Arduino projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check the PID gains</strong>: The PID gains control the behavior of the motor control algorithm. If the gains are not set correctly, the motor might not respond as expected. You can consult the SimpleFOC documentation for guidelines on how to tune the PID gains for your specific application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check the sensor connection</strong>: Make sure that the sensors (encoder or speed sensor) are connected to the board and to the correct pins. You can refer to the SimpleFOC documentation for the recommended wiring scheme for your sensor type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check the PlatformIO configuration</strong>: Ensure that the SimpleFOC library is being included in your project correctly and that the <code>lib_archive</code> option is set to <code>false</code>. If you are using the source version of the library, you will also need to create a symlink as described in the PlatformIO documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check the power supply</strong>: Make sure that the power supply to the motors and the board is stable and within the recommended voltage range. Low voltage or voltage spikes can cause the motor to not move or behave erratically.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If none of the above steps solve the issue, consider providing more details about the project setup, board, and motor configurations, as well as any error messages or debug output, to help narrow down the cause of the problem. Additionally, you may want to consult the SimpleFOC and PlatformIO documentation for more information and troubleshooting tips.</p>

<p>SimpleFOC_AI: I'm here to help you troubleshoot your issue with SimpleFOC not moving your motor using PlatformIO. Based on the context provided, here are some steps you can take to identify and resolve the problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Check your wiring: Ensure that the motor wiring is correctly connected to the appropriate pins on your board and that you have a proper connection between the motor controller and the MCU.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify motor direction: Review the configuration of your motor direction in the SimpleFOC library. Make sure that it matches the physical direction of your motor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review your code: Check that you correctly imported the SimpleFOC library into your project and that you're using the correct functions and parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Motor control example: Attempt to run the motor control example provided with SimpleFOC. If the example works correctly, it is likely that there's an issue in your code. If not, it could be an issue with the library, your board, or your setup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communication between the MCU and motor controller: Make sure that the communication between the MCU and the motor controller is working properly. You can check the serial monitor in PlatformIO to verify if any error messages are being displayed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PlatformIO configuration: Ensure that you've correctly configured your project in the platformio.ini file. Double-check that the board, framework, and library settings are correct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firmware version: Check that you're using the latest version of both SimpleFOC and PlatformIO. If not, try updating them to their latest releases to see if that resolves the issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Debugging: Use PlatformIO's debugging capabilities, such as the Serial Monitor, to help you narrow down the problem.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If none of these steps help, please provide more details about your setup, including the board you're using, the motor controller, and the specific error messages you're encountering. This will help us better understand and assist you with your issue.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can refer to SimpleFOC's documentation and community resources, including the <a href="https://github.com/simplefoc/Arduino-FOC">SimpleFOC GitHub repository</a>, the <a href="https://discord.gg/v2nX4Yv">SimpleFOC Discord server</a>, and the <a href="https://discourse.simplefoc.com/">SimpleFOC community forum</a>.</p>

<div class="markdown-output">
<p>SimpleFOC_AI: I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble getting your SimpleFOC project to move using PlatformIO. There are a few potential causes for this issue.</p>
<p>First, make sure you have correctly configured your project by adding the SimpleFOC library to it and setting the <code>lib_archive</code> option to <code>false</code> in your <code>platformio.ini</code> file. This is necessary for SimpleFOC to compile correctly with PlatformIO.</p>
<p>Next, check your wiring and motor connections. Make sure that the motors are connected to the correct pins and that they have the correct polarity. You can refer to the documentation on the SimpleFOC GitHub page (<a href="https://github.com/simplefoc/Arduino-FOC">https://github.com/simplefoc/Arduino-FOC</a>) for information on how to connect the motors and sensors.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that your motor parameters may not be set correctly. You can find the motor configuration examples in the SimpleFOC library under the <code>examples/MotorConfig</code> folder. Adjust the motor parameters to match your specific setup.</p>
<p>Lastly, ensure that your code is correctly initializing and controlling the motors. Review your code and make sure that you are calling the necessary functions to initialize and control the motors.</p>
<p>If you are still having trouble, consider reaching out to the SimpleFOC community on the SimpleFOC GitHub page or the PlatformIO forum for further assistance.</p>
</div></div>
<p>👉 The answers are very good here, only the second answer remains a bit too long/generic and doest not explicitly mention the <code>lib_archive=false</code> option even though it mentions checking the configuration of the platformio.ini file. But in general the answers are very useful!</p>
<h3 id="test-5">Test 5</h3>
<p>Finally we test whether RAG pipeline is able to retrieve info correctly from <a href="https://docs.simplefoc.com/position_sensors">this section</a> of the docs.</p>

<p>SimpleFOC_AI: The SimpleFOC library supports various types of position sensors, including encoders and magnetic sensors. Encoders are the most commonly used position sensors due to their precision, standardization, and low noise level. Magnetic sensors, on the other hand, use precise magnetic field measurement to estimate position. The library also plans to support IMU sensors in the future. (Refer to the SimpleFOC documentation for more details.)</p>
<p>For encoders, the library supports optical, capacitive, and magnetic types. You can find examples and prices of these encoders on various e-commerce platforms such as eBay or Mouser. Encoder precision and execution efficiency are important factors to consider when selecting an encoder for your application.</p>
<p>Encountering issues during motor initialization can be due to problems with the position sensor or the current sense. Debugging such issues can be facilitated using the SimpleFOCDebug class. This class provides methods like SIMPLEFOC_DEBUG() for logging messages to the console. You can also use FlashStringHelper, disable debug output globally using the build flag SIMPLEFOC_DISABLE_DEBUG, and understand the rationale behind using SimpleFOCDebug instead of Serial.println in the library.

<p>👉 The answers are generally correct but they only mention encoders and magnetic sensors, and forget bout Hall sensors which is weird because it is retrieved in one of the context items (but it is also absent from other chunks which might explain why the LLM does not mention it). However the first answer (output 0) is too long and everything after the first paragraph is too far away from the user query, outputs 1 and 2 are better.</p>

<p>SimpleFOC_AI: Based on the code you've provided, it seems that there are a few issues. Firstly, you have a typo in your variable name for the encoder. It should be named <code>encoder</code> instead of <code>sensor</code>. Also, you need to initialize the software interrupt library and attach the listeners to the correct encoder pins. Here is the corrected code:</p>
<p>```cpp</p>
<h1>include <SimpleFOC.h></h1>
<h1>include <PciManager.h></h1>
<h1>include <PciListenerImp.h></h1>
<p>// define Encoder
Encoder encoder = Encoder(2, 3, 500);</p>
<p>// channel A and B callbacks
void doA(){encoder.handleA();}
void doB(){encoder.handleB();}</p>
<p>// pin change listeners
PciListenerImp listenerA(encoder.pinA, doA);
PciListenerImp listenerB(encoder.pinB, doB);</p>
<p>void setup() {
  // monitoring port
  Serial.begin(115200);</p>
<p>// initialize encoder hardware
  encoder.init();</p>
<p>// interrupt initialization
  PciManager.registerListener(&amp;listenerA);
  PciManager.registerListener(&amp;listenerB);</p>
<p>Serial.println("Encoder ready");
  _delay(1000);
}</p>
<p>void loop() {
  // IMPORTANT - call as frequently as possible
  // update the sensor values 
  encoder.update();</p>
<p>// display the angle and the angular velocity to the terminal
  Serial.print(encoder.getAngle());
  Serial.print("\t");
  Serial.println(encoder.getVelocity());
}
```</p>
<p>Also, don't forget to test the sensor and make sure it's working properly before testing the driver. You can refer to the SimpleFOC documentation for more information on testing sensors and encoders: <a href="https://docs.simplefoc.com/en/latest/getting_started/index.html#testing-the-sensor">https://docs.simplefoc.com/en/latest/getting_started/index.html#testing-the-sensor</a>.</p>
<p>If the problem persists, please provide more details about the hardware setup, error messages, or unexpected behavior you're experiencing.</p>

<p>SimpleFOC_AI: I see you're having trouble getting your code to work with the SimpleFOC library. Based on the provided code snippet, it seems you're trying to use an Encoder object without properly initializing it.</p>
<p>First, let's make sure you have the library installed and the necessary hardware connected as mentioned on the SimpleFOC documentation (https://docs.simplefoc.com/).</p>
<p>Now, in your code, replace "sensor" with "encoder". Also, make sure to change the impulses per revolution parameter accordingly:</p>
<p>```cpp
Encoder encoder = Encoder(2, 3, 500);
// interrupt routine initialisation
void doA(){encoder.handleA();}
void doB(){encoder.handleB();}</p>
<p>void setup() {
  // monitoring port
  Serial.begin(115200);</p>
<p>// initialize encoder hardware
  encoder.init();
  // hardware interrupt enable
  encoder.enableInterrupts(doA, doB);</p>
<p>Serial.println("Encoder ready");
  _delay(1000);
}</p>
<p>void loop() {
  // IMPORTANT
  // read sensor and update the internal variables
  encoder.update();
  // display the angle and the angular velocity to the terminal
  Serial.print(encoder.getAngle());
  Serial.print("\t");
  Serial.println(encoder.getVelocity());
}
```</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, make sure to verify the sensor pins' connections and check for any conflicts with other libraries or hardware. You might also want to go through the SimpleFOC documentation for sensors (https://docs.simplefoc.com/sensors/) to ensure you're using the correct parameters.</p>

<p>SimpleFOC_AI: I see you're having trouble with your code not working as expected. Based on the provided code snippet, there are a few potential issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Incorrect library inclusion: Make sure you have included the SimpleFOC library correctly at the beginning of your code with <code>#include &lt;SimpleFOC.h&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Incorrect sensor initialization: Instead of <code>sensor.init()</code>, it should be <code>encoder.init()</code>. The <code>encoder</code> variable is defined as an Encoder object.</li>
<li>Incorrect pin numbers: Check that pins 2 and 3 are correctly connected to your encoder's A and B signals, respectively.</li>
<li>Interrupt initialization: Ensure that you have the <code>PciManager</code> library installed and included correctly (<code>#include &lt;PciManager.h&gt;</code> and <code>#include &lt;PciListenerImp.h&gt;</code>) for software interrupts.</li>
<li>Encoder object definition: You have a typo in your encoder definition, it should be <code>Encoder encoder = Encoder(2, 3, 500);</code> instead of <code>sensor.init();</code>.</li>
<li>Call to update function: In the loop function, you need to call the update function for the encoder to get the latest readings, <code>encoder.update();</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure to go through the <a href="https://docs.simplefoc.com/docs/classes/Encoder.html">SimpleFOC Encoder documentation</a> for more information. If these suggestions don't help, you may need to provide more context, such as error messages or specific issues you are encountering.</p>

<p>👉 The final test is pretty good here and deals efficiently with code 😎 Interestingly it even cought up a typo in a variable name that was done unintentionally by copying wrong code so pretty impressive. The only thing that is not very good here is that output 0 and 2 both mention to include PCIListener whereas it is actually not needed here.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What's Next?</h2>
<p>Given the results on our little evaluation benchmark, there are several things that could be done to further improve the results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the chunking: having fixed-size chunks is quite rigid and sometimes results in important information being cut out from the chunk. For instance in test 5 the most important chunk from <a href="https://docs.simplefoc.com/sensors">this part</a> of the docs is successfully retrieved, but it is cut before "Hall sensors" are mentionned, resulting in important loss of information in the generated output. We could have longer chunks but increasing length comes with additional cost and might not fit anymore in the context length. More advanced chunking methods might be useful here.</li>
<li>Improve the style of the answers: While I generally like the answers, there are still some undesired behaviors such as mention of context items or lengthy/generic answers. One way to improve that would be to further emphasize the desired style of answer in the base prompt. Another possibility would be to finetune the model on a database of the human query/answers which could be easily retrieved from the SimpleFOC docs.</li>
<li>Improve the docs: at the end this tool might be most useful for SimpleFOC maintainers to understand when the information is not so clearly explained in the docs in cases when the RAG pipeline fails to correctly answer a user query.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously all contributions and suggestions for improvements are very welcome! You can check the <span id="reprotext">Github </span><span class="github-span">Repository</span></a> and raise issues or suggest improvements if you have any 😀</p>
